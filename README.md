# CSBridge Website: Course-in-a-box

This website hosts CS Bridge's course-in-a-box!

  <p>CS Bridge is a cross-border, co-teaching program for high school-level introductory computer science. On this webpage, you will find resources for CS Bridge, in both Java (last updated August 2019) and Python (last updated August 2020). We have course website templates, assignment code, lecture slides, and lesson plans for 2-week and 3-week CS1 summer courses.</p>
